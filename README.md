# utils
Small utilities I use often.

See the [API Docs](API.md).

## Details

This library currently includes a UMD build and raw source files
exported as the module entry point. If you're using a bundler
like Webpack, the raw source files should be usable in the same
manner as an ES module.

## TODO

Create an tree-shakable ES module bundle.

With webpack: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64272342

Or rollup?
